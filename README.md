## üìî SQL Summary
### SQL Facts
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language 
- SQL is pronounced ‚Äúsequel‚Äù (SQL is declarative language)
- SQL is used to access & manipulate data in databases 
- Top SQL DBs are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL

### Database Definitions
- **RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System), Software that stores and manipulates data arranged in relational database tables. 
- **Table** A set of data arranged in columns and rows. The columns represent characteristics of stored data and the rows represent actual data entries.

### SQL Commands Categories
- Data Query Language (DQL) 
	* **SELECT** - Retrieve data from table(s) 
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)  
	* **INSERT** - Insert data into db table 
	* **UPDATE** - Update data in db table 
	* **DELETE** - Delete data from table Data 
- Definition Language (DDL) 
	* **CREATE** - Create db object (table, view, etc.) 
	* **ALTER** - Modify db object (table, view, etc.)  
	* **DROP** - Delete db object (table, view, etc.) 
- Data Control Language (DCL) 
	* **GRANT** - Assign privilege  
	* **REVOKE** - remove privilege

### SQL Data Types
- SQL have more than 40 different data types. But these seven are the most important ones:
	* **Integer** A whole number without a fractional part. Example: 1, 156, 2012412
	* **Decimal** A number with a fractional part. Example:. 3.14, 3.141592654, 961.1241250
	* **Boolean** A binary value. It can be either TRUE or FALSE.
	* **Date**  Example: 2017-12-31
	* **Time** Example: 23:59:59
	* **Timestamp** The date and the time together. Example: 2017-12-31 23:59:59
	* **Text** This is the most general data type. But it can be alphabetical letters only, or a mix of letters and numbers and any other characters. Example: hello, R2D2, Haolia23, 124.765.128.412

### How to select data from a table
```sql
SELECT [Column List]
FROM [Table Name]
WHERE [Search Condition] 
```
Example:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, OrderDate 
FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate > '10/10/2010'
```

### How to insert data in a table
```sql
INSERT INTO [Table Name] ([Column List]) VALUES ([Values]) 
```
Example:
```sql
INSERT INTO Orders (FirstName, LastName, OrderDate) VALUES ('John', 'Smith', '10/10/2010')
```

### How to update data in a table
```sql
UPDATE [Table Name] SET [Column1] = [Value1], [Column2] = [Value2], ‚Ä¶ 
WHERE [Search Condition]
```
Example:
```sql
UPDATE Orders SET FirstName = 'John', LastName = 'Who' 
WHERE LastName='Wo'
```

### How to delete data from a table
```sql
DELETE FROM [Table Name]
WHERE [Search Condition] 
```
Example: 
```sql
DELETE FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate '10/10/2010'
```

### How to group data and use aggregates
```sql
SELECT [Column List], [Aggregate Function]([Column Name]) 
FROM [Table Name] 
WHERE [Search Condition] 
GROUP BY [Column List]
```
Example: 
```sql
SELECT LastName, SUM(OrderValue) 
FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate > '10/10/2010' 
GROUP BY LastName
```

### How to order data
```sql
SELECT [Column List] 
FROM [Table Name]
WHERE [Search Condition] 
ORDER BY [Column List] 
```
Example: 
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, OrderDate 
FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate > '10/10/2010' 
ORDER BY OrderDate
```

### How to select data from more than one table
```sql
SELECT [Column List]
FROM [Table1] 
JOIN [Table2] ON [Table1].[Column1] = [Table2].[Column1] 
```
Example: 
```sql
SELECT Orders.LastName, Countries.CountryName 
FROM Orders 
JOIN Countries ON Orders.CountryID = Countries.ID
```

### Using UNION
```sql
SELECT [Column List] 
FROM [Table1]
UNION 
SELECT [Column List] 
FROM [Table2] 
```
Example: 
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName 
FROM Orders2010 
UNION 
SELECT FirstName, LastName 
FROM Orders2011
```

### Create Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE [Table Name] ( Column1 DataType, Column2 DataType, Column3 DataType, ‚Ä¶. )
```
Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders ( FirstName CHAR(100), LastName CHAR(100), OrderDate DATE, OrderValue Currency )
```
